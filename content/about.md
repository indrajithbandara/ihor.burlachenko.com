### Hey, I'm Ihor

I’m a full-stack software engineer working mostly with PHP stack on back-end and React/React Native on client-side. I have a solid background in developing complex business logic, solving performance problems and managing teams. With over 10 years of experience, I learned how to deliver a high-quality product and meet business needs.

I'm available for onsite work in Wroclaw, Poland and for remote contracting.
