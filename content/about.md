### Hey, I'm Ihor

I'm a software engineer mostly working with PHP stack but not limited to it. I have a solid experience in developing complex business logic, solving performance problems and managing teams. With over 9 years of experience, I learned how to deliver high-quality product and meet business needs.

I'm available for onsite work in Wroclaw, Poland and for remote contracting.
